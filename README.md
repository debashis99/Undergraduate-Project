Digitizing mathematical expressions is becoming more necessary such as when submitting a problem set or writing a research paper, but many recognition systems fail to accurately convert special mathematical symbols such as µ or φ since they are not generally in natural language documents. Same problem occurs when complex mathematical expressions come into play. 
LaTeX has a high learning curve, and the process of typing up mathematical documents is time consuming. Thus, we propose to build a system classifying complex expressions into their corresponding LaTeX code, which can be further used for real-time conversions.
